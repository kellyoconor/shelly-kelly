# Security Review Log

## 2026-04-02 05:53 AM - Nightly Security Review

**AUTO-REDACTION:** ✅ Fixed 6 exposed credentials across 116 files

**API Key Scan:** ✅ No exposed API keys found in markdown/text files (excluding openclaw.json)

**Git History:** ✅ No commits in last 24 hours

**System Config:** ⚠️ **ISSUE FOUND**
- `/data/.clawdbot/openclaw.json` permissions: ✅ 600 (root only)
- **FOUND:** Hardcoded Strava client secret still exposed in openclaw.json
  - Line: `"STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET": "ec781d245ddf798440e1af00362c5371e92054e0"`
  - **ACTION NEEDED:** Update auto-redaction script to catch this pattern

**Process Check:** ✅ Only expected processes running (OpenClaw, Welly daemon, node server)

**Disk Usage:** ✅ Normal levels (root: 58%, /data: 53%)

**WhatsApp Allowlist:** ✅ Correctly restricted to +13018302401 only

**Hardcoded Credentials:** ✅ No additional hardcoded credentials found in workspace files

**SUMMARY:** Security review mostly passed. One hardcoded Strava secret needs attention for auto-redaction script improvement.
